# OnlyToolsAndForces toolkit:

![alt text](https://github.com/professor-calculus/OnlyToolsAndForces/raw/Experimental/Logo.jpg)

To download it just do "git clone https://github.com/professor-calculus/OnlyToolsAndForces.git'' in whatever directory you want to install it. 

This is generally used with Python2.7 but I'm sure later versions will work ok.

Packaged used (pip install):
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- uproot
- pydoop
- numpy
